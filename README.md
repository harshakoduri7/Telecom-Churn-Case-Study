# Telecom-Churn-Case-Study
In the telecom industry, customers have the option to select from various service providers and frequently switch from one operator to another. This highly competitive environment leads to an average annual churn rate of 15-25%. Given that acquiring a new customer is 5-10 times more expensive than retaining an existing one, customer retention has become more critical than customer acquisition.

For many established operators, retaining highly profitable customers has become the top business priority.

To minimize customer churn, telecom companies need to develop models that can predict which customers are most likely to churn.

In this project, we have analyzed customer data from a leading telecom company, built predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn, and determined the key indicators contributing to churn.
